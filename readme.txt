== Description ==
GeoDirectory Framework was designed to be used with the GeoDirectory plugin to create a complete wordpress directory theme, though it can be used without it. You can enable and disable widget areas and also style almost any area of your website from within the Framework Options Page.

It is extremely easy to build a child theme using GeoDirectory framework as a solid base foundation. We will start releasing our own child themes very soon.

* GeoDirectory Framework Responsive Layout -
GeoDirectory Framework is 100% responsive and adapts perfectly to any device screen resolution. It also provides 2 App look-alike sliding menus. 

* GeoDirectory Framework Pages -
Every GeoDirectory plugin page looks good on GDF out of the box. You can customize the look and feel both through the customizer and the framework options pages, without editing one single line of code.
Should you wish to customize further the plugin and modify the templates output, you need to copy the templates from wp-content/plugins/GeoDirectory/templates into your child theme and edit the code. Css can be added to the child theme style.css file.

* GeoDirectory Framework Theme Customizer -
For quick styling modification, the built-in WordPress customizer with live preview can be used. 

* GeoDirectory Framework Options Page -
In the Framework options pages you can:
Set the website layout width. It can be set to fluid or to any fixed width.
Set the Home page top section width, normally containing the map.
Modify every header element styling option.
Modify every body element styling option.
Modify every footer element styling option.
